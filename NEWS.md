# NEWS

In this file I keep track of the changes from release to release.

## v0.3.0

Compatibility for RANSAC.jl `v0.4.0`. Drop support for earlier releases.

## v0.2.0

At RANSAC.jl I removed some undocumented features that had dependencies I didn't really like.
This release makes is easier to install this two package.

### v0.2.1

Minor changes.
Making a release, because next RANSAC.jl changes are going to be breaking.

## v0.1

First release. The code is in the state as I finished my master's thesis.
Not all exported functions are documented, only the main ones. Others are subject to change.

### v0.1.1

Finish documentation (for now at least).
